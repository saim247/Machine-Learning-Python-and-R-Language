# building a SVR
# 1. Collecting a training set T = {X, Y}
# 2. Choose a kernel and it's parameters as well as any regularization needed
# 3. Form the correlation matrix, K
# 4. Train your machine, exactly or approximately, to get contraction coeeficents a = {ai}
# 5. Use those coefficients, create your estimator f(X, a, x*) = y*
